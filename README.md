# LibTML for Object Pascal #

**TML Messaging Suite** is a network messaging library for rapid development of extensible and scalable interfaces. Based on the peer to peer standard protocol [BEEP](http://www.beepcore.org) (Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol), defined in [RFC3080](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3080) and [RFC3081](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3081) libTML is suitable for many use cases and communication patterns. Equipped with a type safe data API, TML can transport hierarchical data structures fast and reliable. [**read more ...**][1]

**The libTML Object Pascal Components** are not only a language binding to the core library but a complete set of non visual components to simplify the usage of libTML with [Embarcadero RAD Studio][2] and [Lazarus][3]. Applications can be developed for multiple platforms.

- Android
- Linux  
- OS X
- Windows

The mapping of libTML data types to the Variant type allows to exchange data organized in dictionaries lists and tables with hierarchical data structures.

The libTML projects are licensed under [LGPL 2.1][9] and can be used for open source and commercial projects according to the [license terms][10]. 

> The components require the [libTML-c core libraries][4].

## How to get help ? ##

The primary source of information is the [documentation of the library][5]. 

To discuss about libTML, ask questions, get help or receive news about releases, planned features and development progress, a [libTML mailing list][6] is available. [Subscribe][7] to the mailing list to get involved.
